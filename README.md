# Fruverth_the_Dragon
A turn-based combat game, with varying difficulties. Beat all the three levels to finish the game. A humble project that was done for the capstone project of an online course
In order to run the game, please use firefox, as Chrome stopped supporting Unity. 
You need to open a new tab in firefox, and enter about:config. 
Then turn the "privacy.file_unique_origin" to "false".
Now, unzip the file to some location, and open the index.html file using Firefox, and the game should run!
